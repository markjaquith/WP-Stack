# This is a sample config file. It manages settings for your remote repository,
# your default domains and your database values. Copy it to config.rb and
# customize it to your own needs.

# // The name of your application. It can be any string.
set :application, "%%APPLICATION%%"

# // A shortname to identify your application.
set :application_id, "%%APPLICATION_ID%%"

# Where is your wp-config.php file located within #{release_path}?
# // Your release path points to the newer copy of your repository, so you must
# // specify where your wp-config.php file is located within your remore repo.
# // WordPress Bareboner puts the file in the "app" subfolder, so it needs to
# // be "#{release_path}/app", but if you are using WordPress-Skeleton, just
# // "#{release_path}" should do the trick and this value should be left empty.
set :application_path, "/app"

# Where are your shell tasks located within #{release_path}?
# // If you're using WordPress Bareboner, the tasks should be by default into
# // /app/tasks. If you are using another WordPress starting repo, you should
# // adjust this value to your own configuration. However, all tasks related to
# // this setting will not be executed if following path does'n t exist.
set :tasks_path, "/app/tasks"

# Repository settings

# // Location of your remote repository.

# // Your preferred method for source control. Supports :accurev, :bzr, :cvs,
# // :darcs, :git, :mercurial, :perforce, :subversion or :none.

# // :deploy_to in production.rb will use this value as default
set :production_domain, "%%PRODUCTION_DOMAIN%%"

# // :deploy_to in staging.rb will use this value as default
set :staging_domain, "%%STAGING_DOMAIN%%"

#
# Set the values for host, user, pass, and name for production, staging and 
# local stages. You can also specify a backup directory where your mysqldumps
# should be saved. Note that placeholders like %%DB_NAME%% and %%DB_PASSWORD%%
# in your wp-config.php file will be automatically replaced when `cap deploy` is
# executed, so you only have to configure these values here.
